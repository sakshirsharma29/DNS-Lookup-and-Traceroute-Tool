# DNS-Lookup-and-Traceroute-Tool

# Problem Statement:
In networking, diagnosing connectivity issues or understanding the route a packet takes to reach a destination is critical. This tool helps users resolve domain names, measure latency (ping), and trace the path (traceroute) a packet takes to reach a remote server â€” similar to tools like ping, tracert, or nslookup.

# Project Overview:
This is a Python-based network diagnostic tool that performs:
- DNS resolution of domain names,
- Latency checking (Ping) using ICMP,
- Traceroute using TTL-limited ICMP packets.
  
It is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and provides clean, easy-to-read output for technical users or network engineers who want to debug connection issues or analyze network performance.
